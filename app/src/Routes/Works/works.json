          "D&ugrave;n &Egrave;ideann Blogh  was composed in the fall of 2006, while I was living in Edinburgh, Scotland. D&ugrave;n &Egrave;ideann is the Gaelic name for Edinburgh, and blogh is a Gaelic word for anecdote or fragment of a story (amazingly similar to a modern blog, or weblog). These are musical snippets of my impressions of the city and its amazing and intensely interesting people.",
          "<i>Auld Reekie</i> is an affectionate nickname for the city, and means \"Old Smokey\" in Gaelic, referring to the smell and somewhat unsanitary conditions of the once coal-fired city. The City Centre, the Royal Mile, Holyrood, Princes Street and the many pubs are an eclectic mix of old and new. The music references bits of the flavor of Edinburgh, from the church bells to the Military Tattoo, from the street bagpipers to uninhibited pub singing.",
          "<i>Portobello</i> is a beautiful, quiet suburb of Edinburgh, situated on the Firth of Forth, where I stayed in a small flat at No. 5 Abercorn Terrace while writing this piece. The beach was one block away, where I discovered the pleasure of Scotland's incomparable single malt whiskys at The Place by the Sea, a friendly pub where dogs and children played in the sand as gulls floated lazily overhead.",
          "<i>Lothian No. 26</i> is the bus line which ran through Portobello to Waverley Station and beyond, a 15 minute ride on a double-decker bus that maneuvered through traffic more skillfully than I would have thought possible had I not experienced it. The ride was an adventure every time, and well worth the two pounds thirty for the day pass.",
          "I shared the time in Scotland with my brother Bruce, who was also working on a project in October of 2006. The conversational interchange between clarinet and bassoon in this piece is based largely on the many discussions about the meaning of life, love, and music that Bruce and I had over a pint or two of Tennents Ale. The fact that I intended the piece for two brothers, my friends Robert (clarinet) and Scott (bassoon) Walzel, made the connection even more pertinent and personal. D&ugrave;n &Egrave;ideann Blogh is dedicated to Robert Walzel for his friendship and prodigious musicianship.",
          "This work was made possible by a Faculty Development Leave from the University of Texas at San Antonio, and premiered at the Utah Arts Festival in the summer of 2007, funded in part by the Composer Assistance Program of the American Music Center."

          "<i>Triqueta</i> was inspired and supported in part by an award from the Artist Foundation of San Antonio in 2006, which funded the composition of the original Esferas da Vida for guitar, horn, jazz rhythm section, violin, viola and cello. At the suggestion of guitarist Matthew Dunne, the piece was enlarged by adding two additional movements, including considerable revision of Esferas da Vida, which became the last movement of Triqueta. The piece is heavily influenced by Brazilian rhythms and character and jazz harmonies. The piece is not programmatic, but the movement titles all refer to shapes in both two and three-dimensional space which suggest motion and generally contributed to the formal structure of each part and to the whole. Triqueta was written for guitarist Matthew Dunne and hornist Michael Gast for the premiere concert of the Southwest Guitar Festival, San Antonio, Texas."

The composition represents the friendship of the Belgian and Texan musicians who first played the piece at a featured performance at the Texas Music Educators Association Convention in 2010.",
          "The work contains many elements of a vague programmatic nature reflecting the history and culture of Belgium, including the visual image of fields of flowers moving gently in the wind, the memory of the many brave men who died in the Battle of Ypres in World War I, and a hint of gypsy folk dancing that is still a part of the vibrant culture of both Belgium and Texas. Most importantly, it is about the common joy of music and love of life that makes us all brothers on this planet."

The composition represents the friendship of the Belgian and Texan musicians who first played the piece at a featured performance at the Texas Music Educators Association Convention in 2010.",
          "The work contains many elements of a vague programmatic nature reflecting the history and culture of Belgium, including the visual image of fields of flowers moving gently in the wind, the memory of the many brave men who died in the Battle of Ypres in World War I, and a hint of gypsy folk dancing that is still a part of the vibrant culture of both Belgium and Texas. Most importantly, it is about the common joy of music and love of life that makes us all brothers on this planet."

The three movements are all based on the same few melodic fragments which are introduced in the first movement, Theme and Three Variations. The variations are a microcosm of the entire sonata, hinting at the textures and emotional context of each movement to come. The second movement includes hints of blues and jazz harmonies, the third looks back at baroque counterpoint, and hints strongly of a two part invention, but all three movements contain the influence of Scottish dance melodies and rhythms."

In this scene, Trevor has received a new and greatly-enhanced synthetic voice. Experimenting with it, Trevor reconsiders questions of appropriateness, authenticity, and his own self-identity. He is beginning to see and Elizabeth encourages him in this regard that he has developed better communication skills than most. Because he must work hard to say anything, Trevor says more with less a trait that Elizabeth finds engaging."

          "Commissioned by clarinetist Robert Walzel, The Devil's Advice to Storytellers was written to be performed at the University of North Texas for his doctoral recital for the DMA degree, specializing in multiple woodwinds. It was intended to explore techniques on the various clarinets that while not necessarily unusual, are not often the basis of the musical structure. These include extreme ranges, wide tremolos, timbral effects, and extreme dynamic contrsts. In all of these cases, \"the Devil is in the details.\" The title comes from a poem by Robert Graves, and though not programmatic in any direct sense, it is devilishly tricky to deal with."

Besides the wonderful food and eclectic ambiance, the characteristic of the Liberty Bar most talked about was the fact that it looked and felt like the building would collapse at any moment, leaning and tilting crazily at seemingly impossible angles in complete defiance of gravity. As of this date, it has not yet fallen, but the restaurant and bar has changed location, much to the consternation of many of its local fans."

Hulme (1883-1917), are short poems and fragments of unfinished thoughts and ideas that have to do with images and unusual perspectives of time and place. The last poem by the composer, is inspired in part by translations of songs of the Coahuiltecan culture, native to Texas before San Antonio was founded in 1718."

Afflicted with motor neurone disease, Trevor is confined to a wheelchair, and cannot speak. Having mastered several generations of voice technologies, he knows their capabilities. In this scene, Trevor has received a new and greatly-enhanced synthetic voice. Experimenting with it, Trevor reconsiders questions of appropriateness, authenticity, and his own self-identity. He is beginning to see and Elizabeth encourages him in this regard that he has developed better communication skills than most. Because he must work hard to say anything, Trevor says more with less a trait that Elizabeth finds engaging."
